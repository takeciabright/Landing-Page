                    The Atlas Series is a crossover sci-fi/contemporary fantasy trilogy for adult audiences consisting of The Atlas Six (2022), The Atlas Paradox (2022), and The Atlas Complex (2024). 
                    The books are predominantly relationship and character driven and feature an ensemble cast of six morally gray characters competing for initiation to an elite secret society in a contemporary alternate universe where magic is built into the economy as capital. 
                    The plot revolves around the Alexandrian Society, caretakers of lost knowledge from antiquity, who promise limitless knowledge, wealth, and power to all who are initiated. 
                    The story begins with six twenty-something magicians (called medeians) being recruited to compete for initiation to the Society by Atlas Blakely, the enigmatic Caretaker initially playing the role of mentor/sage. 
                    While the six candidates are aware that only five of their number will be initiated, they are unaware that the terms of initiation require literal eliminationâ€”five become Alexandrians after choosing one of their cohort to die. 
                    They are also unaware of Atlas's private agenda, which is revealed to have world-ending stakes that only they can prevent.

                <p class="author-bio">
                    Olivie Blake, the pen name of Alexene Farol Follmuth, is the author of bestselling fantasy and sci-fi crossover titles for adults. 
                    She is a lover and writer of stories, many of which involve the fantastic, the paranormal, or the supernatural, but not always. 
                    More often, her works revolve around the collective experience, what it means to be human (or not), and the endlessly interesting complexities of life and love.
                    Olivie tripped and fell into writing after abandoning her long-premeditated track for Optimum Life Achievement while attending law school, and now focuses primarily on the craft and occasional headache of creating fiction. 
                    Her New York Times and Sunday Times bestselling The Atlas Six released 2022 from Tor Books, rounding out the bestselling trilogy with The Atlas Paradox and The Atlas Complex in 2024. 
                    The re-release of her viral literary romance Alone With You in the Ether was followed by backlist titles One for My Enemy and New York Times bestselling Masters of Death, with brand new titles forthcoming in 2025. 
                    She has also been published as the writer for the graphic series Clara and the Devil and a variety of other adult SFF books. 
                    As Alexene, she is the author of YA romance (alexenefarolfollmuth.com). 
                    Olivie lives and works in Los Angeles with her husband and goblin prince/toddler, where she is generally tolerated by her rescue pit bull.
