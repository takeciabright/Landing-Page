                <p>The Atlas Series is a crossover sci-fi/contemporary fantasy trilogy for adult audiences consisting of The Atlas Six (2022), The Atlas Paradox (2022), and The Atlas Complex (2024). 
                    The books are predominantly relationship and character driven and feature an ensemble cast of six morally gray characters competing for initiation to an elite secret society in a contemporary alternate universe where magic is built into the economy as capital. 
                    The plot revolves around the Alexandrian Society, caretakers of lost knowledge from antiquity, who promise limitless knowledge, wealth, and power to all who are initiated. 
                    The story begins with six twenty-something magicians (called medeians) being recruited to compete for initiation to the Society by Atlas Blakely, the enigmatic Caretaker initially playing the role of mentor/sage. 
                    While the six candidates are aware that only five of their number will be initiated, they are unaware that the terms of initiation require literal eliminationâ€”five become Alexandrians after choosing one of their cohort to die. 
                    They are also unaware of Atlas's private agenda, which is revealed to have world-ending stakes that only they can prevent.</p>
